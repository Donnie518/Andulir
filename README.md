# Andulir

**Andulir** is a minimalistic, collaborative API automation testing tool designed for `Spring Boot` and `Spring Cloud`. It is tailored for small development teams and individual developers, aiming to streamline the API testing process.

## Key Features

With **Andulir**, you can:
- Easily annotate the APIs you want to test.
- Automatically generate data for testing once the project is running locally.
- View test results directly in the console.

**Andulir** uses a configuration file, `atest.xml`, to manage all test cases. If the test results are unsatisfactory, you can modify them in this file. The changes will persist, and previous test cases will re-run the next time the project is launched.

After testing an API, you can change its `tag` in `atest.xml` to ignore the test case. You can also manage the file with version control tools like `git`, allowing your teammates or front-end developers to conveniently share API test cases, reducing communication and testing costs.

Before deploying the project to production, all test cases managed by developers can be tested together, making **Andulir** a valuable part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## Workflow

### 1. Setting Up

#### 1.1 Importing Andulir

In the project root directory, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Werun-backend/Andulir.git
```

In IntelliJ IDEA, add Andulir as a module:
1. Go to `File -> New -> Module From Existing Sources`.
2. Select `andulir.iml` in the "Select File or Directory to Import" window (important).
3. Refresh Maven to import the necessary dependencies.

Add Andulir as a dependency in the `pom.xml` of the module where you want to use it:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.andulir</groupId>
    <artifactId>andulir</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

#### 1.2 Configuration

Andulir aims to keep configuration minimal. The only necessary configuration is in the `application.yml` file, where you specify the project path and controller package location:

```yaml
andulir:
  scan-package: org.andulir.controller
```

### 1.3 Usage

#### 1.3.1 Adding Annotations

Use the `@ATest` annotation to mark methods in the `Controller` layer that you want to test, specifying the number of test cases:

```java
@RestController
public class TestController {
  @ATest(2)
  public void test(List<User> users, Integer integer) {
    System.out.println("test");
  }
}
```

#### 1.3.2 Running Andulir

After marking enough APIs, you can start **Andulir** by calling `AndulirApplication.start()` in the `main` method:

```java
import org.andulir.AndulirApplication;

public class ExampleControllerTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AndulirApplication.start(args);
    }
}
```

#### 1.3.3 `atest.xml`

After starting, an `atest.xml` file will appear in the project directory (it will be auto-generated if not present), with generated XML content based on annotated methods. Here is an example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<aTest>
    <controllerMapping name="com.andulir.controller.TestController">
        <methodMapping name="test" status="2">
            ...
        </methodMapping>
    </controllerMapping>
</aTest>
```

The structure of the XML file includes:
- `<aTest>` as the root tag.
- `<controllerMapping>` showing the method's `Controller` class.
- `<methodMapping>` containing specific information about the method.

On the first run, **Andulir** will generate the file and test methods with `status=1`, outputting results to the console.

#### 1.3.4 Editing Test Cases

After initial testing, you may find:
1. The generated test data is suitable; change `status` to 0, marking it as complete.
2. The test data needs modification; adjust data in `atest.xml`, restart the project, and retest.

#### 1.3.5 Version Control

Manage the `atest.xml` file with other files using `git` or similar tools for unified version control.

## Architecture

Andulir comprises three core components: the **Parser**, **Generator**, and **Tester**, which interact with the `atest.xml` file.

### 2.1 Parser

The Parser analyzes annotated interfaces and generates corresponding XML tags, storing them in the file. It currently supports basic types, `List`, custom request types, and their nesting.

### 2.2 Generator

The Generator produces data based on the parsed types, using reflection and the Podam library.

### 2.3 Tester

The Tester reads the XML file, generates corresponding methods, and performs tests. Unlike conventional HTTP-based API testing, **Andulir** accesses methods directly, making it suitable for local testing.

### 2.4 Other Components
- **AndulirConfig**: Manually injects necessary beans.
- **AndulirProperty**: Supports configuration in `application.yml`.
- **Utilities**: Various utility classes required by the program.

## Future Enhancements

### 3.1 Git Diff-Based Automation

Instead of relying solely on annotations, **Andulir** could detect modified interfaces through `git diff`, facilitating fully automated testing.

### 3.2 Improved Request Parsing

Better support for nested `List<>` types and complex parameters.

### 3.3 Simplified Import Process

Uploading **Andulir** to a Maven repository for easier imports.

### 3.4 Bug Fixes & Robustness

Enhance error handling and fault tolerance.

### 3.5 CI/CD Integration

Automate interface testing before deployment with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

### 3.6 Mocking Capabilities

Add support for mocking dependencies to further simplify testing.

## Final Thoughts

**Andulir** was born from the simple needs of everyday development. Its goal is to help small teams and individual developers build robust DevOps processes with ease.
